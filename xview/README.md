XView is an old, simple windowing toolkit for X11. It is required for xlook.

It is written in C, and had the advantage of being very cross platform
compatible. 

However, it is rarely seen or used anymore. We are archiving several
distributions of it here, since there are only one or two places left on the
web where it is available for Mac or Windows (cygwin).
