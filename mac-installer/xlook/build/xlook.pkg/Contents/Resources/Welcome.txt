Welcome to the xlook installation package. This program will install look and the libraries necessary to run it on your computer. 

Before you begin, make sure you have X11 installed under Applications => Utilities. X11 is required for xlook to run. If you do not have X11 installed, you can install it from your Mac OS X installation DVD. It is installed by default on most recent versions of OS X.

After installation, the xlook program will be installed in /Applications, along with some example scripts and data.
