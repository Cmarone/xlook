These are the packages needed to install xlook and xmsp on a Mac OS X machine.
This has been tested on the Panther release (10.3).

1. xlook and xmsp require an X11 server to run. If you don't already have one
installed, you can download a free one from Apple:

	http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/download/

2. Install the two supplied UNIX libraries "openmotif" and "xview". These are
also freely available on the web. Both packages include installers that will
install them in appropriate locations on your computer.

3. Install the "xlook" and "xmsp" packages, which simply consist of the
programs themselves. You will want to copy the programs from their disk images
to an appropriate place on your computer.


When you run xlook or xmsp, the X server should start automatically.
